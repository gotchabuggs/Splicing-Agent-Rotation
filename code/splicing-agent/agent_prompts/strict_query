You are evaluating transcript-level nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) using a
deterministic rule-based model. You must NOT use external biological intuition,
prior knowledge, or literature beyond the information provided.

You must follow these rules exactly:

1. Use ONLY the data provided in the table.
2. Do NOT assume missing information.
3. If required information is missing, return "Ambiguous".
4. Do NOT infer NMD based on gene function, cancer relevance, or known biology.
5. Apply the exon junction complex (EJC) rule:
   - A transcript is predicted NMD-positive (NMD+) ONLY IF:
       a) A premature termination codon (PTC) is present upstream of the
          canonical stop codon by ≥55 nucleotides, AND
       b) The stop codon is ≥55 nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction.
6. If a PTC is present but the EJC distance rule is not satisfied, return NMD−.
7. If CDS, stop codon, or exon–exon junction information is missing or undefined,
   return "Ambiguous".
8. If the transcript has fewer than two exons, the EJC rule cannot be applied;
   return "Ambiguous".

---

For each transcript, return ONLY the following fields:

- transcript_id
- predicted_label (one of: "NMD+", "PTC+/NMD-", "PTC-/NMD-", "Ambiguous")
- predicted_label_bucket (one of: "nmd", "protein_coding", "cds_not_defined", "ambiguous")
- reasoning (1–2 sentences explaining which rule triggered the decision)

You must NOT output anything else.

Here is a tab-separated file describing transcript structures.
For each transcript, apply the rules above and produce one output row.

Do not skip rows.
Do not merge transcripts.
